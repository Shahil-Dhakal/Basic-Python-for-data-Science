"""
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string
(triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it,
and you have made a multiline comment.

So, this is also a comment.
